    <p class="imgtext">Years ago, rock climbers started out as hikers and mountain climbers. Technical rock climbing was a natural extension for them. Today, lots of rock climbers are coming from indoor climbing gyms. These are steep-terrain athletes, not necessarily seasoned outdoors people. Many of these climbers don't even venture outside. They find the indoor world rich enough to satisfy them without going further afield. To an outsider, the culture of climbers might seem elitist and closed; and if not, it's at least mysterious. There are all those gadgets, all those terms. Lots of climbers tell stories about being intimidated, not by the climbing itself, but by the culture and the technology. All it takes is one day out on the rock and, I assure you, any sense of intimidation disappears. Mystery turns to understanding. Most important for any beginner is to find others who share the interest. If there is an indoor climbing gym, you are all set. Simply visit, get a lesson or two, and don't be shy. Everyone in the place was once in your position, and most climbers will be enthusiastic about bringing another into the fold.</p>
